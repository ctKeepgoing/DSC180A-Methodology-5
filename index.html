<title>Quarterly Project Discussion</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?</h1>
<p>This quarter, we discuss several importance topics regarding the nature of healthcare dataset,
the challenges of using machine learning techniques in healthcare, and important steps to do before
handling a big data like MIMIC III.</p>

<h2>Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project</h2>
<p>We will still be working with the same dataset, MIMIC III, with some potential approaches such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Applied NLP in clinical notes for identifying diagnosis and procedures</li>
<li>Glycaemic Control Monitoring: analyse patterns of blood glucose monitoring in the ICU and determine
the efficacy of different insulin regimens or glycaemic control protocols.</li>
<li>Diabetes as a Comorbidity: Explore how the presence of diabetes affects the outcomes of patients
admitted to the ICU for other primary reasons. For instance, does diabetes as a comorbidity increase
the risk of complications after major surgeries or with infections?</li>
</ul>

<h2>What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?</h2>
<p>For the next quarter, I would spend more time learning about MIMIC data, how it was structured,
and how to use it in the most effective ways.</p>

<h2>What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?</h2>
<p>I would like to explore other machine learning techniques such as NLP, LCA, K-means.</p>
