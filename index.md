# What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?

This quarter, we discuss several important topics regarding the nature of healthcare datasets,
the challenges of using machine learning techniques in healthcare, and important steps to take before
handling big data like MIMIC III.

## Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project

We will still be working with the same dataset, MIMIC III, with some potential approaches such as:

- Applied NLP in clinical notes for identifying diagnosis and procedures
- Glycaemic Control Monitoring: analyse patterns of blood glucose monitoring in the ICU and determine
the efficacy of different insulin regimens or glycaemic control protocols.
- Diabetes as a Comorbidity: Explore how the presence of diabetes affects the outcomes of patients
admitted to the ICU for other primary reasons. For instance, does diabetes as a comorbidity increase
the risk of complications after major surgeries or with infections?

## What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?

For the next quarter, I would spend more time learning about MIMIC data, how it was structured,
and how to use it in the most effective ways.

## What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?

I would like to explore other machine learning techniques such as NLP, LCA, K-means.
